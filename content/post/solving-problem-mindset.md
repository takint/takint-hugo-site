Now, “problem-solving” as a term in school (where you were five minutes ago) is kind of partial. It’s rather a “problem-solving training” — it’s kind of predictable. In real life, on the other hand, solving the same problems, again and again, is the last thing you want to do — and it’s not your job.

Your job is to solve them once and for all — big difference. And to do that, you need to identify them, assess them, question, plan, collaborate, initiate, investigate, communicate, adapt. All that with a positive attitude, utilizing experience, common sense, agility, and passion.

The skills that matter most, that you’re actually measured by, are far beyond technical. The only expression I can think of, that sort-of describes them, is one word: Professionalism. But that’s not all, since the goal is to solve the problem. The formula might look great, and still not work for reasons no one really cares about — because the goal is the result.
