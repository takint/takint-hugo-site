#### Object Oriented Programming:
As we all may know, it is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects".

- **Class:** classes are blueprint of an object. In other words, a class is a template while object are instances of the class.

- **Object:** an object is a unique entity which has some properties and methods.

- **Abstraction** is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users.

- **Polymorphism** provides a way to perform a single action in different forms.

- **Encapsulation** is the process of wrapping properties and functions (methods) within a single unit.

- **Inheritence** is a concept in which some properties and methods of an class is being used by another class.
